## Disclaimer

This product interacts with on-chain data and is intended for use in decentralized environments. While efforts have been made to ensure reliability and security, blockchain technologies and smart contracts inherently carry risks.

Security audits and testing have been conducted on various components of the system. However, vulnerabilities may still exist, and unforeseen issues can arise. Users should understand that utilizing this product does not eliminate all risks associated with on-chain transactions, data feeds, or smart contract interactions.

By using this product, you acknowledge and accept these risks. It is strongly recommended that users implement robust risk management strategies and conduct independent assessments before deploying the Risk Engine or integrating it into their DeFi product. Use at your own risk.
